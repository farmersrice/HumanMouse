# HumanMouse

When run, PathSaver opens a decently-sized window. Click between any two points to generate a mouse path. Once you're done, close the window, and it autosaves the paths to "paths.txt".
HumanMouseDemo utilizes these saved paths in order to generate humanlike mouse paths between any two points that you click.

Paths are adjusted between any two points using simple translation, rotation, and scaling.

Better support for selecting paths based on their duration and original length may be added in future.
